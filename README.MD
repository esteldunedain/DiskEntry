# DiskEntry

We will be investigating the wall effect on the splash formation from a disk entry, in collaboration Multiphase Flow Research Laboratory (MFRL) at Lakehead University, using experimental and numerical methods.

In this case I present the setup of our first preliminary numerical simulation. The 3" disk was dropped from a 30 cm height, into a water tank of 15x15 cm2. For this #OpenFOAM model, we are using a moving mesh technique (via dynamicMotionSolverFvMesh), instead of overset grids, reducing the computational cost significatively.


## Getting Started

* Run the `prepare.sh` to generate the mesh and setup the simulation.
* Then run the case with `interIsoFoam`
